    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p id="description">Syrniki are sweet pancakes with a soft inside composed of farmer's cheese. They are a traditional part of Eastern Slavic breakfast. Berries or other fruits can be embedded within for an extra sweet touch. Additionally, they go well with jam.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb farmer's cheese</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 + 1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3-4 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, crumble the farmers cheese into little pieces with a fork.</li>
        <li>Add 2 eggs and mix well. Add ½ cup flour (reserve ⅓ cup for step 2), sugar, and salt. Mix well, using the fork to break apart any clumps of flour or farmer's cheese. Add raisins, if using. The 'batter' will be thick like dough, not like traditional pancake batter.</li>
        <li>Prepare a small bowl with about ⅓ cup flour - you will use it to dredge the pancakes. Scoop out approximately ¼ cup pancake dough at a time. (See recipe notes below).  Use your hands to gently flatten the dough into a small patty. Dredge the pancake with flour on both sides. Shake off the extra flour and set aside until you are ready to cook the syrniki pancakes. </li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat 3-4 tablespoons of vegetable oil, and gently place the flour-dredged cheese pancakes into the pan using a spatula. Cook on medium-low heat for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until each side is golden brown. Place on a paper towel to cool.</li>
        <li>To serve, sprinkle with powdered sugar, or drizzle with maple syrup, honey, whipped cream. Or try these syrniki the traditional Russian way - with sour cream and your favorite fruit preserves.</li>
    </ol>
